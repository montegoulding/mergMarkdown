A fully functional (X)HTML renderer is included.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>*&#9;**Optimized for speed**</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>&#9;`Sundown` is written in C, with a special emphasis on performance. When wrapped</p>\n<p>&#9;on a dynamic language such as Python or Ruby, it has shown to be up to 40</p>\n<p>&#9;times faster than other native alternatives.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>*&#9;**Zero-dependency**</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>&#9;`Sundown` is a zero-dependency library composed of 3 `.c` files and their headers.</p>\n<p>&#9;No dependencies, no bullshit. Only standard C99 that builds everywhere.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Credits</p>\n<p>-------</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>`Sundown` is based on the original Upskirt parser by Natacha Port&eacute;, with many additions</p>\n<p>by Vicent Marti (@vmg) and contributions from the following authors:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>&#9;Ben Noordhuis, Bruno Michel, Joseph Koshy, Krzysztof Kowalczyk, Samuel Bronson,</p>\n<p>&#9;Shuhei Tanuma</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Bindings</p>\n<p>--------</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>`Sundown` is available from other programming languages thanks to these bindings developed</p>\n<p>by our awesome contributors.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>- [Redcarpet](https://github.com/vmg/redcarpet) (Ruby)</p>\n<p>- [RobotSkirt](https://github.com/benmills/robotskirt) (Node.js)</p>\n<p>- [Misaka](https://github.com/FSX/misaka) (Python)</p>\n<p>- [ffi-sundown](https://github.com/postmodern/ffi-sundown) (Ruby FFI)</p>\n<p>- [Sundown HS](https://github.com/bitonic/sundown) (Haskell)</p>\n<p>- [Goskirt](https://github.com/madari/goskirt) (Go)</p>\n<p>- [Upskirt.go](https://github.com/buu700/upskirt.go) (Go)</p>\n<p>- [MoonShine](https://github.com/brandonc/moonshine) (.NET)</p>\n<p>- [PHP-Sundown](https://github.com/chobie/php-sundown) (PHP)</p>\n<p>- [Sundown.net](https://github.com/txdv/sundown.net) (.NET)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Help us</p>\n<p>-------</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>`Sundown` is all about security. If you find a (potential) security vulnerability in the</p>\n<p>library, or a way to make it crash through malicious input, please report it to us,</p>\n<p>either directly via email or by opening an Issue on GitHub, and help make the web safer</p>\n<p>for everybody.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Unicode character handling</p>\n<p>--------------------------</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Given that the Markdown spec makes no provision for Unicode character handling, `Sundown`</p>\n<p>takes a conservative approach towards deciding which extended characters trigger Markdown</p>\n<p>features:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>*&#9;Punctuation characters outside of the U+007F codepoint are not handled as punctuation.</p>\n<p>&#9;They are considered as normal, in-word characters for word-boundary checks.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>*&#9;Whitespace characters outside of the U+007F codepoint are not considered as</p>\n<p>&#9;whitespace. They are considered as normal, in-word characters for word-boundary checks.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Install</p>\n<p>-------</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>There is nothing to install. `Sundown` is composed of 3 `.c` files (`markdown.c`,</p>\n<p>`buffer.c` and `array.c`), so just throw them in your project. Zero-dependency means</p>\n<p>zero-dependency. You might want to include `render/html.c` if you want to use the</p>\n<p>included XHTML renderer, or write your own renderer. Either way, it's all fun and joy.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If you are hardcore, you can use the included `Makefile` to build `Sundown` into a dynamic</p>\n<p>library, or to build the sample `sundown` executable, which is just a commandline</p>\n<p>Markdown to XHTML parser. (If gcc gives you grief about `-fPIC`, e.g. with MinGW, try</p>\n<p>`make MFLAGS=` instead of just `make`.)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>License</p>\n<p>-------</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Permission to use, copy, modify, and distribute this software for any</p>\n<p>purpose with or without fee is hereby granted, provided that the above</p>\n<p>copyright notice and this permission notice appear in all copies.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>    THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\" AND THE AUTHOR DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES</p>\n<p>    WITH REGARD TO THIS SOFTWARE INCLUDING ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF</p>\n<p>    MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS.
